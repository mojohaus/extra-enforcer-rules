Require Encoding

  This rule checks files for a required encoding and fails if the guessed encoding doesn't match the required one.
  
  <<Note that this rule uses icu4j to guess the source encoding of a file. Use of US-ASCII is hard to detect 
  and should not be used as a required encoding.>>

    []

  The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * <<<encoding>>> - Required encoding. Default value <<<$\{project.builder.sourceEncoding\}>>>.
   
   * <<<includes>>> - List of files to include, separated by comma or pipe

   * <<<excludes>>> - List of files to exclude, separated by comma or pipe

   * <<<useDefaultExcludes>>> - enable SCM file exclusions, enbled by default.

   * <<<failFast>>> - Should the rule fail after the first error or should the errors be aggregated. Default true.

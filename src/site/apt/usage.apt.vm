Usage

  To use any of the extra rules you just need to add the extra rules as a dependency of the Apache Maven Enforcer
  Plugin. This is best achieved by adding the dependency within a <<<pluginManagement>>> section

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>1.0</version>
          <dependencies>
            <dependency>
              <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
              <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
              <version>${project.version}</version>
            </dependency>
          </dependencies>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    <pluginManagement>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+

  Note: If you are using Maven 2.x then, as a result of the classloader design in Maven 2.x, you may need to use
  the <<<pluginManagement>>> technique in the ultimate parent of your reactor build in order to ensure that
  the rule is available.

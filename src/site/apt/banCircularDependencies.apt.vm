Ban Circular Dependencies

  This rule checks the dependencies and fails if the groupId:artifactId combination exists in the list of direct or transitive dependencies.

  The following parameters are supported by this rule:

  * <<scopes>> - a list of scopes (e.g. test, provided) to include when scanning artifacts

  * <<ignoredScopes>> - a list of scopes (e.g. test, provided) to ignore when scanning artifacts

  * <<ignoreOptionals>> - a boolean, if <<<true>>> all dependencies which have <<<<optional>true</optional>>>> are ignored.

  * <<searchTransitive>> - a boolean, specify if transitive dependencies should be searched (default) or only look at direct dependencies.

Require Contributor Roles

  This rule checks that certain roles in a project are represented by contributors.

  Say you want to enforce a policy that in every project there is at least one
  contributor representing a specific role, e.g. at least one contributor has
  the role "business engineer".

  The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * <<requiredRoles>> - Comma separated list of roles which must be represented
   by at least one contributor.

   * <<validRoles>> - Comma separated list of roles which are additionally allowed. <<<requiredRoles>>> are always valid, so the union of <<<requiredRoles>>> and <<<validRoles>>> forms the set of all accepted roles.
   By default it has the value <<<*>>>, which means every role is accepted. This rule does <<not>> support Ant-patterns.

Enforce Bytecode Version

  This rule checks the dependencies transitively and fails if any class of any dependency is having its bytecode version higher than the one specified.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * maxJdkVersion - the maximum target jdk version in the 1.x form (e.g. 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 or 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...)

   * maxJavaMajorVersionNumber - an integer indicating the maximum bytecode major version number (cannot be specified if maxJdkVersion is present)

   * maxJavaMinorVersionNumber - an integer indicating the maximum bytecode minor version number (cannot be specified if maxJdkVersion is present)

   * includes, excludes - optional lists of artifact patterns to include or exclude ([groupId]:[artifactId]:[type]:[version] with wildcards and optional segments)

   * ignoreClasses - a list of classes to ignore bytecode version problems. Wildcards can be specified using the * character.

   * ignoredScopes - a list of scopes (e.g. test, provided) to ignore when scanning artifacts

   * ignoreOptionals - a boolean, if <<<true>>> all dependencies which have <<<<optional>true</optional>>>> are ignored.
